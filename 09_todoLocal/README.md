## Why do I need local storage with Context API?

For creating a setup like Todo, local context becomes necessary?

Why?

Imagine creating a long list of Todos for task management and refreshing the page to see all of them gone.
To avoid this scenario, we include local storage inside the context so that as long as the project is alive,
The todos stay intact.
