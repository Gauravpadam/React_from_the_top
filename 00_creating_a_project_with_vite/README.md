## Why use Vite or Parcel over create_react_app?

`npx create_react_app` is a deprecated command; reason being, `create_react_app` offers a heavy bundle.
Most of the times you won't initially need a heavy bundle; lighter projects are good.

Vite allows to create a custom bundle by installing a minimal build for the project,
with only the minimum required dependencies and scripts to get started with using react

## To use Vite:

Source: https://vitejs.dev/guide/

1. npm create vite@latest
2. Enter project name
3. choose `react` project
4. choose language preference (I chose js)
5. project is ready
